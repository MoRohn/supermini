# Autonomous Settings Simplification Plan

## Overview
Transform SuperMini from a configuration-heavy application to an intelligent, autonomous system that makes optimal decisions based on task context, eliminating the need for manual user settings while maintaining superior performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Current User Configuration Points
1. **Temperature Control**: Manual slider (0-100, default 70)
2. **Auto-Continue Settings**: Manual checkbox with fixed max iterations (10)
3. **Mode Selection**: Manual task type selection
4. **Max Tokens**: Manual numeric input (default 4096)
5. **Model Selection**: Manual Claude/Ollama choice
6. **Memory Settings**: Manual enable/disable with limit configuration

### Problems with Current Approach
- Users must understand AI model parameters to make optimal choices
- Fixed auto-continue logic doesn't adapt to response quality
- No context-aware temperature adjustment
- Manual mode selection requires AI expertise
- One-size-fits-all approach reduces effectiveness

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Autonomous Temperature Management System

**Concept**: Dynamically determine optimal temperature based on task type, complexity, and context.

**Task-Specific Temperature Profiles**:
- **Code Tasks**: 0.2-0.4 (precise, deterministic code generation)
- **Multimedia Tasks**: 0.6-0.8 (creative analysis and descriptions)
- **RAG Tasks**: 0.3-0.5 (accurate information retrieval with some flexibility)
- **Automation Tasks**: 0.1-0.3 (precise, reliable script generation)
- **Analytics Tasks**: 0.2-0.4 (methodical data analysis)
- **Exploration Mode**: 0.7-0.9 (high creativity for discovery)
- **Enhancement Mode**: 0.4-0.6 (balanced improvement suggestions)

**Dynamic Adjustment Factors**:
- Prompt complexity (simple prompts = lower temperature)
- Error recovery (failed attempts = lower temperature for precision)
- Creative requirements detected in prompt language
- Previous task success patterns

### 2. Intelligent Auto-Continue System

**Response Quality Analysis**:
- Parse response completeness using semantic analysis
- Detect natural conversation stopping points vs. continuation cues
- Analyze code completeness and functionality
- Evaluate task fulfillment against original prompt

**Adaptive Continuation Logic**:
- **High-quality complete responses**: No continuation
- **Incomplete but progressing responses**: Continue with focused prompts
- **Question-ending responses**: Continue with clarifying context
- **Error-containing responses**: Continue with error correction focus
- **Creative exploration**: Continue until creative exhaustion detected

**Smart Iteration Limits**:
- Code tasks: 2-5 iterations (based on complexity)
- Creative tasks: 3-8 iterations (based on creative flow)
- Problem-solving: 1-10 iterations (based on progress indicators)

### 3. Mode-Specific Deterministic Behavior

**Task Auto-Classification Enhancement**:
- Advanced semantic analysis of prompts
- Context-aware classification using memory patterns
- Confidence scoring for classification accuracy
- Hybrid approaches for ambiguous requests

**Optimized Mode Prompts**:
- **Code Mode**: Focus on functionality, best practices, testing
- **Multimedia Mode**: Emphasize detailed analysis, creative insights
- **RAG Mode**: Prioritize accuracy, source attribution, synthesis
- **Automation Mode**: Stress reliability, error handling, documentation
- **Analytics Mode**: Emphasize statistical rigor, visualization

### 4. Autonomous Model Selection

**Intelligence Selection Criteria**:
- Task complexity assessment
- Required reasoning depth
- Creative vs. analytical requirements
- Response time preferences
- Previous success patterns

**Fallback Strategies**:
- Smart retry with different parameters
- Model switching based on failure types
- Progressive complexity reduction for stubborn tasks

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Intelligence Classes

```python
class TaskIntelligence:
    """Autonomous decision-making for task processing"""
    
    def determine_optimal_temperature(self, prompt: str, task_type: str, context: dict) -> float:
        """Dynamically calculate optimal temperature"""
        
    def should_continue(self, response: str, iteration: int, task_context: dict) -> bool:
        """Intelligent continuation decision"""
        
    def calculate_max_iterations(self, task_type: str, complexity_score: float) -> int:
        """Dynamic iteration limit calculation"""

class ResponseAnalyzer:
    """Analyze AI responses for quality and completeness"""
    
    def analyze_completeness(self, response: str, original_prompt: str) -> float:
        """Score response completeness (0.0-1.0)"""
        
    def detect_continuation_cues(self, response: str) -> dict:
        """Identify specific continuation needs"""
        
    def assess_quality(self, response: str, task_type: str) -> dict:
        """Comprehensive quality assessment"""

class TaskClassifier:
    """Enhanced autonomous task classification"""
    
    def classify_with_confidence(self, prompt: str, files: List[str]) -> Tuple[str, float]:
        """Return task type with confidence score"""
        
    def suggest_hybrid_approach(self, prompt: str) -> List[str]:
        """Suggest multi-mode processing when beneficial"""
```

### Phase 2: Settings Removal and Simplification
