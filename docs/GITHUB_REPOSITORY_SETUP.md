Quality Checks:
  - Code linting (flake8, black, isort)
  - Security scanning (bandit, safety)
  - Test coverage (pytest with coverage)
  - Integration tests
  - Autonomous safety tests
```

### 2. Release Workflow

The `.github/workflows/release.yml` handles:

```yaml
Release Automation:
  - Automatic release creation on version tags
  - Multi-platform build artifacts
  - Release note generation from CHANGELOG.md
  - Asset uploading (binaries, packages)
  - Notification to community channels
```

### 3. Additional Recommended Workflows

#### Dependency Update Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-update.yml
name: Dependency Updates

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v8
        with:
          stale-issue-message: 'This issue has been automatically marked as stale.'
          days-before-stale: 60
          days-before-close: 7
```

## Community Features

name: CodeQL Analysis
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

## Autonomous Enhancement Integration

### 1. GitHub App Authentication

For autonomous enhancements, configure GitHub App or Personal Access Token:

#### Using GitHub App (Recommended)
```bash
# Create GitHub App with permissions:
# - Contents: Read & Write
# - Pull requests: Read & Write
# - Issues: Read & Write
# - Metadata: Read

# Set environment variables:
export GITHUB_APP_ID="your-app-id"
export GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="path-to-private-key.pem"
export GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID="installation-id"
```

#### Using Personal Access Token
```bash
# Create token with scopes:
# - repo (full control)
# - workflow
# - write:packages

export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your-token-here"
```

### 2. Autonomous Enhancement Configuration

Repository settings for autonomous contributions:

```yaml
# .github/autonomous-config.yml
autonomous_enhancement:
  enabled: true
  max_prs_per_day: 3
  auto_merge: false
  require_human_review: true
  
  allowed_file_patterns:
    - "*.py"
    - "*.md"
    - "*.yml"
    - "*.yaml"
    - "requirements*.txt"
  
  restricted_patterns:
    - ".github/workflows/*"
    - "security/*"
    - "*.key"
    - "*.env"
  
  required_checks:
    - ci/test-suite
    - ci/security-scan
    - ci/autonomous-safety-validation
  
  reviewers:
    - maintainer1
    - maintainer2
  
  labels:
    - ai-generated
    - enhancement
    - needs-review
```

### 3. Safety Validation Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/autonomous-safety.yml
name: Autonomous Enhancement Safety
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths:
      - '**.py'

jobs:
  safety-check:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ai-generated')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate autonomous changes
        run: |
          python scripts/validate_autonomous_changes.py
      - name: Security scan
        run: |
          bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            // Add safety validation results to PR
```

## Release Management

### 1. Semantic Versioning

Follow semantic versioning (semver) with these guidelines:

```yaml
Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Examples:
  - 2.1.1: Current release
  - 2.1.2: Bug fixes and patches
  - 2.2.0: New features, backward compatible
  - 3.0.0: Breaking changes

Release Types:
  - alpha: Early development (2.2.0-alpha.1)
  - beta: Feature complete, testing (2.2.0-beta.1)
  - rc: Release candidate (2.2.0-rc.1)
  - stable: Production ready (2.2.0)
```

### 2. Release Process

#### Automated Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Update version in VERSION file
echo "2.1.2" > VERSION

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new release notes
# Add entry for new version

# 3. Commit changes
git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v2.1.2"

# 4. Create and push tag
git tag -a v2.1.2 -m "Release v2.1.2"
git push origin main --tags

# 5. GitHub Actions automatically creates release
```

#### Manual Release Steps
1. **Prepare Release Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v2.1.2
   git push -u origin release/v2.1.2
   ```

2. **Update Version Files**
   - Update `VERSION` file
   - Update version in `README.md`
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md`

3. **Create Release PR**
   ```bash
   # Create PR from release branch to main
   gh pr create --title "Release v2.1.2" --body "Release preparation for v2.1.2"
   ```

4. **Tag and Release**
   ```bash
   # After PR is merged
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v2.1.2 -m "Release v2.1.2"
   git push origin v2.1.2
   ```

### 3. Release Assets

Automatic asset generation includes:

```yaml
Assets:
  - Source code (zip, tar.gz)
  - macOS application bundle (.app)
  - Windows executable (.exe)
  - Linux AppImage
  - Python wheel (.whl)
  - Documentation (PDF)
```
